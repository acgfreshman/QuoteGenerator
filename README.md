# Welcome this is the official repo for project 1
##UCLA ACM HACK

If you've missed the first session, check out the blog post first: http://hackucla.com/blog/session-1-intro-to-android/

###Description
This project is for intermediate/advanced students. Work with your team on this weekly project, 
and you can receive points for completing it. If you are feeling confident you can attempt to 
complete the project without the skeleton, but it will be a lot easier to use it. You will not 
get credit for completing the exercises on the blog post as well, so choose the one most appropriate for your 
skill level. Please only submit one .zip file per team, and include your team access 
code (Found on Hack School Dashboard) in a text file. We will be uploading the project solution towards the end of the week, so if you haven't cracked it by then look at the solution to learn the correct implementation.

###Hints
* Start with the xml layout. 
* Add missing textviews and image buttons for the other 
two professors, you should base their styling off the first one. 
* Add IDâ€™s for UI objects that you want to interact with in the code.
* Finally go to the Main Activity to setup all the components, and add the correct 
behavior for random quote generation.
